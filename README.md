## Overview:

This repository contains all information for the IMPTC Dataset inlcuding data specifications, overviews, sample data and download links. The data availability is a continous process for the rest of the year 2023. New sequences will be added every month, starting with the first batch at the end of august 2023. Therefore this site will be updated regularly. The data is provided in a per sequence style (including context and synchronization) or in a classical trajectory focused style (only vru trajectories, with defined seperate train, eval and test splits).
In order to achieve a consistent data basis and comparability, the first 250 sequences will be standardized as version 1.0.

---
#### Release Schedule:
##### 08. August 2023:
Sample sequences are available. 

##### 31. August 2023:
First set of 50 sequences is available.

##### 05. September 2023:
Second set of 50 sequences is available.

##### 14. September 2023:

## The Dataset:
The dataset consists of 250 unaffected sequences recorded on everyday public road traffic. The sequences are recorded at different daytimes, seasons and weather conditions using a combination of LiDAR and camera sensors. The dataset provides high quality VRU and vehicle trajectories as well as additional context information like weather data, traffic light signal status, a segmentation map, a sequence overview video and more. The data is provided in a per sequence style (including context and synchronization) or in a classical trajectory focused style (only vru trajectories, with defined seperate train, eval and test splits).

#### Object types:
A detailed description of the vru and vehicle data formats can be found here: [[vru specification]](data_formats/vru_tracks.md), [[vehicle specification]](data_formats/vehicle_tracks.md). In total the dataset covers nine different classes of road users listed below:

```md
- Pedestrian
- Cyclist
- Motorcyclist
- (E)-Scooter driver
- Wheelchair driver
- Pedestrian with stroller
- Car
- Truck
- Unknown object
```

#### Context types:

```md
- Weather data
- Traffic light signal status
- Ground classification / Segmentation map
- OSM Reference map
- GPS Timestamp data synchronisation
- Overview video 
```

#### Coordinate System:
The dataset uses its own 3D world coordinate system. All tracks refer to this coordinate system and use meter (m) as unit. The local used coordinate system can be converted to global UTM (Zone 32) by applying the following shift:

```
# Conversion to UTM (Zone 32)
|       |     X     |     Y      |   Z    |
| local |    0.0    |     0.0    |   0.0  |
| gobal | 511570.38 | 5535358.32 | 150.22 |
```

Its origin position is located at one of the four sidewalk egdes and marked on the topview map by a small red dot with a green and blue line. The lines indicate the X- and Y- axes, with the blue line representing the X-axis pointing towards eastern direction and the green line representing the Y-axis pointing towards northern direction. The Z-axis, in red, points towards the sky, with ground level representing zero height. The following image illustrates location and directions.

!["Coordinate system and origin"](images/coord_origin.jpg  "Coordinate system and origin")

###### Altitude gradient:
The complete intersection area has a steady altitude gradient of 4-5%. In some cases this can affect height measurements.

#### Ground Classification / Segmentation Map:
The following eight different ground types are included within the intersection area. A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[segmentation map specification]](data_formats/ground_plane.md). 

**The map can be downloaded here:** [[Segmentation Map]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPcvJv-etmImUCoVugBAJUJmFrLcd5kR/view?usp=sharing)

```md
- Road
- Sidewalk
- Crosswalk
- Bikelane
- Curb
- Road Line
- Undefined Ground
- Unknown
```

!["Coordinate system and origin"](data_formats/ground_plane.png  "Coordinate system and origin")

#### Timestamp Master:
A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[timestamp specification]](data_formats/timestamp_master.md). This file includes all GPS timestamps within the sequence for data synchronization. All context and track data are derived from this master. The system operates at a frequency of 25 Hz.

#### Weather Data:
A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[weather data specification]](data_formats/weather_data.md). The data refreshing rate is one new data per 10 seconds (0.1 Hz). In total five weather classes and six weather describing parameters are included and listed below:

```md
# Classes:
- Sunny/Cloudy
- Light rainfall
- Strong rainfall
- Snowy
- Foggy 

# Parameters:
- Temperatur
- Precipitation Type
- Precipitation Amount
- Wind Direction
- Wind Force
- Visibility
```

#### Traffic Light Signal Data:
A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[traffic light specification]](data_formats/traffic_light_data.md). The data refreshing rate is 1 Hz. In total nine traffic light signal groups are tracked and represented by the following six different light states:

```md
# Light states:
- Off
- Red
- Red-yellow
- Yellow
- Green
- Yellow-Blinking
```

##### Signal groups:
The nine signal groups are illustrated below. The groups k1 till k6 represent the different vehicle lanes and driving directions. The groups f1 till f3 represent the three signalized pedestrians crossings.

## Data Structure:
**The data structure for a sequence** is always the same and is described by the following scemantic overview:

```

**The data structure for the only vru trajectory data path** is always the same. Each trajectory within a set is stored within a seperate subfolder defined by the trajectories id. It containes the singles track data and an overview topview image for visualization. In addition all trajectories of a set are combined within the xy_set_tracks.json file for easy loading.

 and is described by the following scemantic overview:
