### Overview

This repository contains all information for the IMPTC Dataset, including data specifications, overviews, sample data, and download links. The dataset consists of two different subtypes with different research targets. The sequence focused dataset targets scene understanding and interaction/social-based trajectory forecasting topics. The VRU trajectory focused dataset targets classical single VRU trajectory forecasting research.

##### Sequence focused 
The data is split into single, fully synchronized, independent, and unaffected sequences. The sequences are recorded on everyday public road traffic at different times, seasons, and weather conditions using a combination of LiDAR and camera sensors operating at 25 Hz. The dataset provides high-quality VRU and vehicle trajectories and additional context information like weather data, traffic light signal status, a segmentation map, a sequence overview video, and more. The sequence-focused data consists of 270 sequences, including 2700+ VRU trajectories with an average duration of 32 seconds and 14600+ vehicle trajectories.

##### VRU Trajectory focused
The trajectory-only dataset consists of the classical train, eval, and test split. The dataset consists of 5133 VRU trajectories splitted into: 3585 train, 400 eval, and 1148 test trajectories. Train and eval sets are extracted from the 270 above-described sequences and from a additional set of non-publically released data. The separate test set is extracted from closed, non-publically released sequences.

### The VRU Trajectory Dataset

Train and eval sets are extracted from the 270 released sequences and from a additional set of non-publically released data. The separate test set is extracted from closed, non-publically released sequences.


| VRU class | Train | Eval | Test |
|:----:|:-----------:|:----:|:-----------:|
| pedestrian | 2628 | 310 | 843 |
| cyclist | 617 | 58 | 179 |
| motorcycle | 233 | 22 | 103 |
| scooter | 85 | 9 | 14 |
| stroller | 22 | 1 | 9 |
| wheelchair | 0 | 0 | 0|
| **Total** | **3585** | **400** | **1148** |

### The Sequence Dataset
The dataset consists of 270 unaffected sequences recorded on everyday public road traffic. The sequences are recorded at different times of the day, seasons, and weather conditions using a combination of LiDAR and camera sensors operating at 25 Hz. The dataset provides high-quality VRU and vehicle trajectories and additional context information like weather data, traffic light signal status, a segmentation map, a sequence overview video, and more.


#### Object types
A detailed description of the vru and vehicle data formats can be found here: [[vru specification]](data_formats/vru_tracks.md), [[vehicle specification]](data_formats/vehicle_tracks.md). In total, the dataset covers eight different classes of road users. The total amount of each object class is listed below:

| VRU class | Number of tracks |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| pedestrian | 1920 |
| cyclist | 503 |
| motorcycle | 203 |
| scooter | 80 |
| stroller | 17 |
| wheelchair | 0 |
| **Total** | **2723** |


| Vehicle class | Number of tracks |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| truck/bus | 447 |
| car | 14190 |
| **Total** | **14637** |

#### Context types

```md
### Context types:
- Weather data
- Traffic light signal status
- Ground classification / Segmentation map
- OSM Reference map
- GPS Timestamp data synchronisation
- Overview video 
```

---
#### Coordinate System
The dataset uses its own 3D world coordinate system. All tracks refer to this coordinate system and use the meter (m) as a unit. The locally used coordinate system can be converted to global UTM (Zone 32) by applying the following shift:

```
### Conversion to UTM (Zone 32)
|       |     X     |     Y      |   Z    |
| local |    0.0    |     0.0    |   0.0  |
| gobal | 511570.38 | 5535358.32 | 150.22 |
```

Its origin position is located at one of the four sidewalk edges and marked on the top view map by a small red dot with a green and blue line. The lines indicate the X- and Y-axis, with the blue line representing the X-axis pointing towards the eastern direction and the green line representing the Y-axis pointing towards the northern direction. The Z-axis, in red, points towards the sky, with ground level representing zero height. The following image illustrates the location and directions.

!["Coordinate system and origin"](images/coord_origin.jpg  "Coordinate system and origin")

###### Altitude gradient
The complete intersection area has a steady altitude gradient of 4-5%. In some cases, this can affect height measurements.

#### Ground Classification / Segmentation Map
The following eight different ground types are included within the intersection area. A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[segmentation map specification]](data_formats/ground_plane.md). 

**The map can be downloaded here:** [[Segmentation Map]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPcvJv-etmImUCoVugBAJUJmFrLcd5kR/view?usp=sharing)

```md
### Ground segmentation types
- Road
- Sidewalk
- Crosswalk
- Bikelane
- Curb

- Undefined Ground
- Unknown
```

#### Timestamp Master
A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[timestamp specification]](data_formats/timestamp_master.md). This file includes all GPS timestamps within the sequence for data synchronization. All context and track data are derived from this master. The system operates at a frequency of 25 Hz.

---
#### Weather Data
A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[weather data specification]](data_formats/weather_data.md). The data refreshing rate is one new data per 10 seconds (0.1 Hz). In total, five weather classes and six weather describing parameters are included and listed below:

```md
### Classes:
- Sunny/Cloudy
- Light rainfall
- Strong rainfall
- Snowy
- Foggy 

### Parameters:
- Temperatur
- Precipitation Type
- Precipitation Amount
- Wind Direction
- Wind Force
- Visibility
```

---
#### Traffic Light Signal Data
A detailed description of the data format can be found here: [[traffic light specification]](data_formats/traffic_light_data.md). The data refreshing rate is 1 Hz. In total, nine traffic light signal groups are tracked and represented by the following six different light states:

```md
### Light states:
- Off
- Red
- Red-yellow
- Yellow
- Green
- Yellow-Blinking
```

##### Signal groups
The nine signal groups are illustrated below. The groups k1 till k6 represent the different vehicle lanes and driving directions. The groups f1 till f3 represent the three signalized pedestrian crossings.
