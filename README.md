## The Dataset
The dataset consists of 250 unaffected Sequences recorded on everyday public road traffic. The sequences are recorded at different daytimes, seasons and weather conditions using a combination of LiDAR abd camera sensors.


**Object types and context data:**\
The dataset covers 8 different classes of road users and additional context information. The following table gives an overview.
| VRU Classes | Vehicle Classes | Context Data |
|---|---|---|
| Pedestrian | Car | Traffic Light Signals |
| Cyclist | Bus/Truck | Weather Status |
| Motorcycle | Unknown | Ground Location |
| Scooter Driver |  | Ground Type |
| Wheelchair Driver |  | GPS Timestamps |

**Ground Types:**\
The following seven different ground types are included.
| Ground types |
|---|
| Road, Bicycle Lane, Sidewalk, Crossing, Curb, Road Line, Ground |

**Weather Data:**\
The following four weather classifications and seven weather parameters are included.
| Classifaction | Parameters |
|---|---|
| Sunny/Cloudy, Rainy, Snowfall, Foggy | Temperatur, Precipitation Type, Precipitation Amount , Wind Direction, Wind Force, visibility |

**Traffic Light Signal Data:**\
The following five traffic light signal types are included. In total nine traffic light signal groups are tracked.
| Classifaction |
|---|
| Green, Yellow, Red, Yellow-Red, Off |
