## The Dataset:
The dataset consists of 250 unaffected Sequences recorded on everyday public road traffic. The sequences are recorded at different daytimes, seasons and weather conditions using a combination of LiDAR and camera sensors. The dataset provides high quality VRU and vehicle trajectories as well as additional context information like weather data, traffic light signal status, a OSM-Reference Map and more.

##### Object types:
The dataset covers nine different classes of road users. A detailed description of the vru and vehicle data formats can be found here: [vrus](data_formats/vru_tracks.md) and [vehicles](data_formats/vehicle_tracks.md).

- Pedestrian
- Cyclist
- Motorcyclist
- (E)-Scooter driver
- Wheelchair driver
- Pedestrian with Stroller
- Cars
- Trucks
- Unknown Object

##### Context types:

- Weather data
- Traffic light signal status
- Ground classification
- OSM Reference Map
- GPS Timestamp data synchronisation
- Overview video 

##### Ground Classification:
The following seven different ground types are included.

- Road
- Bicycle Lane
- Sidewalk
- Crossing
- Curb
- Road Line
- Undefined Ground

##### Weather Data:
The following five weather classifications and six weather parameters are included. A detailed description of the data format can be found [here](data_formats/weather_data.md).

###### Description Labels:
